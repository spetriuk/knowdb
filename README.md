# KnowDB

Repository for my Github Pages hosted site. The site represents my knowledge base for personal use. 

Link: [https://spetriuk.github.io](https://spetriuk.github.io)

The theme I use is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

For notes that I take from the Internet, I place a link to the source at the bottom of the page.

I use [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) for note keeping, [Joplin Web clipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/) to save web pages from the browser in .md format.

For generating this site I use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.
